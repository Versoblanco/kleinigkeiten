# Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz". (From: https://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/)

# write a function that prints the nth Fibonacci number

# You have the numbers 123456789, in that order. Between each number, you must insert either nothing, a plus sign, or a multiplication sign, so that the resulting expression equals 2001. Write a program that prints all solutions. (There are two.) This is a pretty tricky problem, actually, if you donâ€™t think to use recursion

# write a function that reverses a string
