## About

*Small Task* is a repository for quick code and texts like:
1. Easy and short solutions built from scratch, most of which are already performed by built-in functions.
2. Supposedly typical job interview questions.
3. Small challenges or *katas*. Just for fun.
4. Patches of code that, for reasons only revealed to a previous me-version, I wanted to keep.

If a task grows big enough I move it to their own project.

## Functions
Most of these functions and challenges are presented in many basic programming or computer science courses. I took my list from [here](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/five-essential-phone-screen-questions), and from the classic [MIT 6.001](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/) course book [*Structure and interpretation of computer programms*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html) by Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman.

As their goal is to practice basic skills I looked for my own solutions, that are not neccessarily the best, easiest or prettiest ones, though all of them should work in a wide range of cases.

### Count

- [x] [Print count from a to n](/count.py)
- [x] [Print countdown from n to a](/count.py)
- [x] [Count function with conditional output](/FizzBuzz.py)

### Parse
  - [x] [Reverse a string](/reverse_str.py)
  - [ ] Find

### Recursion
- [ ] Fibonacci:
  - [ ] Compute F<sub>n</sub>
  - [ ] Find n of F<sub>n</sub>
- [ ] Compute n! (factorial)

### Math
- [x] [Check if a is multiple of b](/multiple.py)
- [x] [Find smallest common multiple](/smallest_common_mult.py)
- [ ] Check if n is prime

### Hodgepodge
- [ ] TOC generator for GitHub Markdown
