## About

*Kleinigkeiten* (from German 'little things') is a repository for short programms and coding exercises like:
1. Quick solutions for simple tasks.
2. Elementary versions of built-in and standard functions, coded from scratch.
3. Small challenges or [*katas*](http://codekata.com/). Just for fun.
4. Patches of code that, for reasons only revealed to a previous me-version, I want to keep.
5. New Year's coding resolutions.

## Functions
You'll find most of these in many basic programming or computer science courses. You can see from where I picked mine in the [Bibliography](#bibliography).

As their goal is to learn and/or practice basic skills I looked for my own solutions, that are not always the best, easiest or prettiest ones, though all of them should work in a wide range of cases.

### Count
- [x] [Count from a to n](/count.py)
- [x] [Countdown from n to a](/count.py)
- [x] [Count function with conditional output](/FizzBuzz.py)

### Parse
  - [x] [Reverse a string](/reverse_str.py)
  - [ ] Find

### Recursion
- [x] [Fibonacci](/fibonacci.py)
  - [x] Compute F<sub>n</sub>
  - [x] Find n of F<sub>n</sub>
- [ ] Compute n!

### Math
- [x] [Check if a is multiple of b](/multiple.py)
- [x] [Find smallest common multiple](/smallest_common_mult.py)
- [x] [Check if n is prime](/primes.py)
- [x] [Get a list of primes from a range](/primes.py)
- [x] [Find odds in a range](/odds.py)
