## About

*Small Task* is a repository for quick code and texts like:
1. Easy and short solutions built from scratch, most of which are already performed by built-in functions.
2. Supposedly typical job interview questions.
3. Small challenges or *katas*. Just for fun.
4. Patches of code that, for reasons only revealed to a previous me-version, I wanted to keep.

If a task grows big enough I move it to their own project.
